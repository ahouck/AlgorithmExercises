# AlgorithmExercises

This is a record of some coding exercises I've done, mostly from sites like leetcode and codesignal. 

Each file represents one exercise with the problem stated in the comments in the format:

```
/** PROBLEM: <Stating the problem>
 *          
 *           <any supporting examples>
 *
 *  SOLUTION: <Description of approach used to solve the above problem>
 *
 * COMPLEXITY: <Big O execution time>
 */
 ```

All solutions are in Javascript ES6.
